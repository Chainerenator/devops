git merge 
git branch -f HEAD

git reset HEAD^   /  local^
Let's take a moment to review the new commands:
	git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
	git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
	git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.
Additionally, you learned a way to add multiple files to the staging area with a single command:
git add filename_1 filename_2
